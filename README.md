First of all, I am not a lawyer, and will not be consulting one for this project. I have tried to stick to [Apple's guidance](https://www.apple.com/legal), but if you find something that is not in compliance, please let me know. If you are Apple and have an issue with this project, please contact me and I will be happy to work with you to resolve it, or take the project down if necessary.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To run the project you need Rust and cargo set up. After that you can use `bun install` to install the front-end dependencies. Then make sure you are in a Python environment with the packages `requests` and `unicorn`. Now you can run `cargo tauri dev` to start the project.
